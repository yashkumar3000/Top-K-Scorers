# Top-K-Scorers
This is a C++ code for the top K scorer of a test.

So here I have created a code for the selecting the top scorers in a test given their name and score you can select the top scorer.

Implementation:
1. The implementation is by the use of priority queues. 
2. Using priority we can decrease the complexity significantally for a large data set.
3. Complexity: O(KlogN) where,
               K: Number of top scorer needed
               N: Total participants of the test
